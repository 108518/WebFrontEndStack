# WebFrontEndStack
web front end stack: browsers, platforms, libraries, frameworks, tools etc.

# What and why?
Have you ever wondered:
* what technologies web front end really includes? 
* how many do I possess?


I could not find a really comprehensive diagram that shows the web front end technology stack, so I come up with my own version.

There might be issues here and there, like the category, the individual ones, but the beautity is you can modify it as you want.
